# Git Workflow Rules
- ALWAYS create a feature branch for new work
- NEVER commit directly to master/main
- Branch naming convention: feature/[feature-name] or fix/[bug-name]
- Use kebab-case for branch names
- Create pull request when feature is complete
- Delete feature branches after merge

# Project-Specific Rules
- All API keys must be in .env.local
- Never commit .env files
- Test all searches with both correct and misspelled titles
- Document all technical decisions in docs/internal/DECISIONS.md
