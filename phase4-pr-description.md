# Phase 4: Design System & UI Polish

## 🎯 Overview

This PR completes Phase 4 of the Where Can I Watch project, transforming the UI from a stark developer aesthetic to a warm, consumer-friendly design while adding several key optimizations.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 Complete Design System Overhaul
- **New Color Palette**: Replaced purple with warm teal/blue-green (`hsl(173 58% 39%)`)
- **Typography**: Switched to Inter font for better readability and warmth
- **Backgrounds**: Warm off-whites and deep blue-grays instead of pure black/white
- **Enhanced Contrast**: Better visibility in both light and dark modes

### 🌗 Smart Dark Mode
- Respects OS dark mode preference on initial load
- Live syncs with OS theme changes
- Remembers user preference in localStorage
- Smooth transitions between themes

### 📱 Mobile Responsiveness
- Fixed "TV Shows" text wrapping on iOS
- Responsive search bar with smaller padding/icons on mobile
- Improved tab spacing for small screens
- Better placeholder text to prevent cutoff

### 🚀 UI Enhancements
- Auto-fetch providers on component mount (no click required)
- Provider preview showing top 3 logos directly on cards
- TV/Movie filtering tabs with result counts
- Franchise detection (e.g., "Star Wars" finds Andor, Mandalorian)
- Empty state messages for filtered results
- Smooth animations and hover states
